# StayCatin-project
As a Data analyst at StayCatin.com, I was tasked with providing key insights to help management make informed decisions based on property details, reviews, and price fluctuations. After analyzing the dataset, I present the following insights:

Top 10 Earners: Through a bar chart, we identified the top 10 properties that generated the highest revenue. This analysis revealed the characteristics and amenities that contributed to their success, offering valuable information for property selection and investment decisions.

Relationship between Price and Earnings: Utilizing a scatter plot, we explored the correlation between property prices and their earnings. Understanding this relationship can assist in devising optimal pricing strategies to maximize earnings without compromising occupancy rates.

Shore Location Earnings: We analyzed properties situated near shore areas and compared their earnings to non-shore properties using a grouped bar chart. This highlighted the potential advantages of shore locations, allowing us to capitalize on these lucrative areas and attract more bookings.

Price and Reviews Impact: By visualizing a bubble chart, we studied the influence of property prices and reviews on earnings. This enabled us to identify high-earning properties with positive reviews, emphasizing the importance of guest satisfaction for revenue growth.

Based on these insights, I recommend focusing on properties similar to the top earners, implementing dynamic pricing strategies, marketing and promoting shore locations, and enhancing the guest experience to boost reviews and bookings. Data-driven decisions will pave the way for sustainable growth and success for StayCatin.com.
